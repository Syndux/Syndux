### About Me
I'm a dedicated Software Developer with a profound passion for harnessing technology to instigate meaningful change and innovation. My journey began with a foundation in Computer Engineering, and I've been on an unending quest for knowledge, leading me to the dynamic realm of software engineering. This journey has been defined by an unwavering commitment to continuous growth and adaptability, making me a valuable asset to any team.

My education and experience have equipped me with a robust command of software development technologies, frameworks, and best practices. My skill set spans a wide range, including JavaScript, NodeJS, React/Redux, Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, HTML/CSS/Tailwind, and agile scrum methodologies.

If you're as passionate about technology and innovation as I am or if you see opportunities for collaboration, I'd love to connect and explore how we can collectively make a difference through technology. I may also be reached at hueynguyen2022@gmail.com.
