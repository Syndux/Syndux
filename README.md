### About Me
I'm a dedicated Software Developer with a profound passion for harnessing technology to instigate meaningful change and innovation. My journey began with a foundation in Computer Engineering, and I've been on an unending quest for knowledge, leading me to the dynamic realm of software engineering. This journey has been defined by an unwavering commitment to continuous growth and adaptability, making me a valuable asset to any team.

From a young age, my fascination with technology was evident. At just 7 years old, I assembled my very first computer, a hobby that has flourished into countless more builds and an invaluable role as the go-to tech support for friends and family. I've tackled a spectrum of issues, from minor external device glitches to orchestrating network services in residential settings. My insatiable thirst for technological understanding has naturally led me into the realm of software engineering, where I see the potential to make profound contributions to services and technologies that not only enhance my life but also positively impact countless others.

My education and experience have equipped me with a robust command of software development technologies, frameworks, and best practices. My skill set spans a wide range, including JavaScript, NodeJS, React/Redux, Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, HTML/CSS/Tailwind, and agile scrum methodologies.

If you're as passionate about technology and innovation as I am or if you see opportunities for collaboration, I'd love to connect and explore how we can collectively make a difference through technology. I may also be reached at hueynguyen2022@gmail.com.
